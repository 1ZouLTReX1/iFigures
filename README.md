# iFigures / Hapi :smile: (Work in Progress)

### **HAPI = HTML Activity Platform Incubator**

A platform of HTML forms (a.k.a activities) that students and children can complete at home. 📝
These activities can be used to teach subjects and provide questions & excercises with answer checking. 💯

✔ No registration or log in  
✔ Works completely on internet browsers - no installation required  
✔ Activities are constantly and automatically saving your progress in local storage  
✔ Activities can be saved as single html files that can be used without internet  


**Please keep in mind** that This repository is a work in progress and will have many issues.  
The activity creator currently supports only Hebrew. The activities themselves are fully english supported though.
