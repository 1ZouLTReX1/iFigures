# iFigures / Hapi (Work in Progress)

### HAPI = HTML Activity Platform Incubator

A platform of HTML forms (a.k.a activities) that students and children can complete at home.
These activities can be used to teach subjects and provide questions & excercises with answer checking.

**Works on internet browsers - no installation required!**

> KEEP IN MIND that This repository is a work in progress and will have many issues.
> The activity creator currently supports only Hebrew. The activities themselves are fully english supported though.

* Example activity (in Hebrew): https://hapi-app.netlify.app/
