# iFigures / Hapi :smile: (Work in Progress)

### HAPI = HTML Activity Platform Incubator

A platform of HTML forms (a.k.a activities) that students and children can complete at home. :memo:  
These activities can be used to teach subjects and provide questions & excercises with answer checking. :100:

:white_check_mark: **No registration or log in!**  
:white_check_mark: **Works completely on internet browsers - no installation required!**  
:white_check_mark: Activities are constantly and automatically saving your progress in local storage  
:white_check_mark: Activities can be saved as single html files that can be used without internet  


KEEP IN MIND that This repository is a work in progress and will have many issues.  
The activity creator currently supports only Hebrew. The activities themselves are fully english supported though.
