This page is pretty much essential to read if you don't know the basics of NPM, nor the package ecosystem
in JavaScript.

## NPM = Node Package Manager

NPM is a package managing tool that lets developers share code between projects.

It consists of a command line program, and an [online database](https://npmjs.com) of packages,
called the npm registry.

NPM is the 1<sup>st</sup> most popular package manager for JavaScript today,
with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) being the 2<sup>nd</sup> most popular
(yarn is developed and maintained by facebook, but it still uses the npm registry).

NPM is shipped with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (A JavaScript runtime engine) by default.

It is very much like the pip module and the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) registry in Python.
